Analysis and classification learning fro french bakery prices

# IDEAS 
- Maybe create a "type" column to make analysis in terms of sandwiches, vienoisseries, pains etc and not article by article
- éliminer ou regrouper les articles qui n'apparaissent qu'une fois? Potentiellement ils ont arrÊté de se vendre???
- Créer une variable temps (semaine, jour, heure de la journée etc) pour analyses temporelles

# Global facts
- Our dataset has 234005 client purchases with 7 features each. 
- January 2021 to september 2022

Articles that sold only 1 time ---> Maybe eliminate them???
